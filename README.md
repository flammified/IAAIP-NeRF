# Rendering forward facing driving scenes using Neural Radiance Fields

This repository contains the code for the Interdisciplinary Advanced AI Project (IAAIP) of the TU Delft. During this project we have worked on `Rendering forward facing driving scenes using Neural Radiance Fields`. The project took 10 weeks in total.

The repository structure is as follows:

* `slices`: directory containing slices of different datasets that were used to evaluate different systems.
* `scripts`: directory containing scripts for (i.e.) converting from slices to different input files and generating masks using semantic segmentation.
* `models`: directory containing trained models.


## The project

The project consists of three parts:

1) Initial literature study inventarising the current state of NeRF in rendering forward facing driving scenes
2) An evaluation of current technologies on driving scenes and common failure modes
3) An attempt at improving rendering by removing dynamic objects from the scene

## Evaluation of current technologies
